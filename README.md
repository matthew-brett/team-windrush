# Team-Windrush - an example project

This is an example project from the [2018-19 Data Science for Everyone
class](https://matthew-brett.github.io/dsfe).

The project is by:

* Elise de Wildt
* Edward Pinder
* Zaid Bangee

Elise kindly agreed to allow the files to be public.

The project got good marks.

To review, start at the `READ_ME_PROJECT_SUBMISSION.ipynb` notebook.

Some of you reading this will be doing the 2019-20 version of the same "data
science for everyone" class, and this project will be roughly equivalent to
what you should expect to do.  If you are doing the "design and analysis 2"
course, remember that you have covered more than the students covered in the
first-year undergraduate class, so your projects will tend to be more
substantial, using a wider range of techniques.

You will notice that the project starts with one question, then moves to other
questions as it becomes clear that it was not possible to answer the question
the project members set themselves.

There is no need to copy the exact approaches here.  For example, this project uses a rather fancy piece of Matplotlib code to make a nice diagram - but that was only one sensible way to solve that problem.
